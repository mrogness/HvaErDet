# hvaerdet
Norsk-Engelsk translator for use between friends within a Discord server. Born due to the discrepancy between friends who have taken Norwegian classes and those who haven't.

Keywords:
$nt - for inline norwegian translation, for ex. `$nt jeg liker mat` will have the bot respond in the Discord Chanel with `"I like food"`.

$rnt - for reply norwegian transaltion, meaning if you reply to a message that's in norwegian and write $rnt the bot will repsond with the translation of that replied-to message.
